# COMP3000
COMP3000 Dissertation project

This project implements facial recognition into the QTrobot with a cloud-based database.

The following libraries have been used:

•firebase_admin

•face_recognition

•datetime

To use this program, simply run it and allow it to take a picture of your face. If your face has been setup as one of the known faces, you will be given authorisation and it will be logged in the database.

Once your face has been recognised, an email will be sent to the registered email address held in the database.
